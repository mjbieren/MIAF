# ðŸ§¬ Mafft and IQtree for All FastaFiles (MIAF)

Automate the alignment and phylogenetic analysis of multiple FASTA files using **MAFFT**, **IQ-TREE**, and optional tools like **PhyloPyPruner** and **ClipKIT**. This tool supports both **local execution** and **SLURM cluster environments**, and is highly configurable for parallel processing.
